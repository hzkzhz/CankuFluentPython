### CHAPTER 10 Design Patterns with First-Class Functions

设计模式的具体实现跟语言有关，比如python就没必要实现Iterator，因为它就在python的基因里了。

#### Case Study: Refactoring Strategy

##### Classic Strategy
> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.


**Context:**
> Provides a service by delegating some computation to interchangeable components that implement alternative algorithms. In the ecommerce example, the context is an Order, which is configured to apply a promotional discount according to one of several algorithms.

**Strategy:**
> The interface common to the components that implement the different algorithms. In our example, this role is played by an abstract class called Promotion.

**Concrete strategy:**
> One of the concrete subclasses of Strategy. FidelityPromo, BulkPromo, and LargeOrderPromo are the three concrete strategies implemented.
