### CHAPTER 18 with, match, and else Blocks

#### Context Managers and `with` Blocks

The with statement was designed to simplify some common uses of try/finally, which guarantees that some operation is performed after a block of code.

```python
with open('mirror.py') as fp: 
    src = fp.read(60)
```

context manager:
`__enter__, __exit__`


##### The contextlib Utilities
`contextlib`

##### Using `@contextmanager`

In a generator decorated with `@contextmanager`, `yield` splits the body of the function in two parts: everything before the `yield` will be executed at the beginning of the with block when the interpreter calls `__enter__`; the code after yield will run when `__exit__` is called at the end of the block.
