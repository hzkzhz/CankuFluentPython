### CHAPTER 19 Concurrency Models in Python

concurrent and parallel

three approaches to concurrency: threads, processes, and native coroutines.

#### The Big Picture

Starting a thread or a process is not cheap. A coroutine is cheap to start but hard to monitor as threads or processes.

#### A Bit of Jargon

**Concurrency**: handle multi tasks at the same time, run one at a time or in parallel
**Parallelism**: run multi tasks at the same time
**Execution unit**: three kinds in python: processes, threads, and coroutines
**Process**: Program isolated from each other or parent
**Thread**: An execution unit within a single process. Threads in same process share the same memory space. Consumes less resources than Process
**Coroutine**: A function that can suspend itself and resume later. Consumes less resources than Thread and Process
Queue: FIFO order data structure
Lock:
Contention:
