## PART II Functions as Objects
### CHAPTER 7 Functions as First-Class Objects
 Treating functions as objects. In Python, all functions are first-class.

#### Treating a Function Like an Object
`__doc__`


#### Higher-Order Functions
`sorted(fruits, key=len)`
`map, filter, reduce`
##### Modern Replacements for map, filter, and reduce

listcomp or genexp

#### Anonymous Functions
`lambda`
当匿名函数太复杂时，还是老老实实写 def 靠谱。

#### The Nine Flavors of Callable Objects
`callable()`

#### User-Defined Callable Types
class 里实现 `__call__` 方法，可以让一个对象变得callable
