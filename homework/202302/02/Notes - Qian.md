A runtime error occurs while a program is running or when you first attempt to start the application. The error sometimes goes away on its own by simply reopening the app, but if not, there are a number of things you can try.

At runtime, Python doesnâ€™t care about declared types. It uses duck typing only. Mypy flagged an error in alert_bird, but calling it with daffy works fine at runtime.
