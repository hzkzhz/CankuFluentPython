#### Types Are Defined by Supported Operations

we assume that type is a set of values and a set of functions that one can apply to these values.

#### Types Usable in Annotations

##### The Any Type
```python
def double(x: Any) -> Any:
    return x * 2
```

More general types have narrower interfaces, i.e., they support fewer operations.

No type can support every possible operation, so using `Any` prevents the type checker from fulfilling its core mission: detecting potentially illegal operations before your program crashes with a runtime exception.

###### Subtype-of versus consistent-with

Liskov Substitution Principle—LSP:

if an object of type T2 substitutes an object of type T1 and the program still behaves correctly, then T2 is subtype-of T1

consistent-with:
1. Liskov substitution
2. Every type is consistent-with `Any`
3. `Any` is consistent-with every type

##### Simple Types and Classes

Simple types like int, float, str, bytes and classes may be used in type hints.

**`int` is consistent-with `float`, and `float` is consistent-with `complex`**

##### Optional and Union Types

`Optional[str]` is actually a shortcut for `Union[str, None]`, which means the type may be `str` or `None`.

py3.10 以后 可以用`|` 代替 `Union`

```python
arg: str | None = None
```

```python
isinstance(x, int | str)
```

If possible, avoid creating functions that return Union types.

`Union[int, float]` is redundant because `int` is consistent-with `float`. If you just use `float` to annotate the parameter, it will accept `int` values as well.

##### Generic Collections
```python
def tokenize(text: str) -> list[str]:
    return text.upper().split()
```
3.9 之后可以用 `list, tuple, set, ...` 来代替`typing.List, Tuple, typing.Set, ...` 了

##### Tuple Types
* Tuples as records: `tuple[float, float])`
* Tuples as records with named fields: `typing.NamedTuple`
* Tuples as immutable sequences: `tuple[str, ...]]`

##### Generic Mappings
```python
index: dict[str, set[str]] = {}
```

##### Abstract Base Classes
`collections.abc`:
`Mapping, MutableSequence, Sequence, Set, MutableSet, ...`
`Number, Complex, Real, Rational, Integral, ...`

##### Iterable
differences with Sequence

##### Parameterized Generics and TypeVar
```python
T = TypeVar('T')
def xxxx(seq: Sequence[T]) -> list[T]:
    ...
```

`abc.Hashable`
`HashableT = TypeVar('HashableT', bound=Hashable)`

##### Static Protocols
写一个 protocol 继承自 `typing.Protocol`，可以作为`TypeVar` 的 `bound`

##### Callable
`Callable[[ParamType1, ParamType2], ReturnType]`

##### NoReturn

This is a special type used only to annotate the return type of functions that **never return**.
