#### Processes, Threads, and Python’s Infamous GIL
一堆python的基本概念，看上去就是又慢又挫不怪我的意思

#### A Concurrent Hello World

##### Spinner with Threads
`\|/-` 
`Anser: 42`
`threading.Event`

When the `main` thread sets the `done` event, the `spinner` thread will eventually notice and exit cleanly.

##### Spinner with Processes

`multiprocessing`


The basic API of threading and multiprocessing are similar, making it easy to convert simple programs from threads to processes
`multiprocessing.shared_memory`
`ShareableList`

##### Spinner with Coroutines

`asyncio.run(coro())`
`asyncio.create_task(coro())`
`await coro()`

Never use `time.sleep(…)` in asyncio coroutines unless you want
to pause your whole program. 

##### Supervisors Side-by-Side
