Data attributes and methods are collectively known as attributes in Python. 
The simplest way to implement dynamic attributes in Python, the @property decorator and the __getattr__ special method

Note that FrozenJSON does not transform or cache the original dataset. As we tra‐ verse the data, __getattr__ creates FrozenJSON instances again and again. That’s OK for a dataset of this size, and for a script that will only be used to explore or convert the data.
对小规模数据集的探索和处理,就当做小脚本一样,比如一下Streaming Majority 脚本,简单直接的data pipeline
```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n1 |  awk '{print $2}'

```
