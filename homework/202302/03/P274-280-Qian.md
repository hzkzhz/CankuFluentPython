# Tuple Types

### Tuples as records
```
def geohash(lat_lon: tuple[float, float]) -> str: # a tuple with two float fields.
    return gh.encode(*lat_lon, PRECISION)
```

### Tuples as records with named fields
```
class Coordinate(NamedTuple): # Coordinate has extra methods added by NamedTuple, like ._asdict(), and could also have user-defined methods.
    lat: float
    lon: float
```

### Tuples as immutable sequences
`return [tuple(sequence[i::num_rows]) for i in range(num_rows)]`
