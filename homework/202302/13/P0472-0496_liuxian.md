#### Goose Typing

What goose typing means is: `isinstance(obj, cls)` is now just fine…as long as cls is an abstract base class—in other words, cls’s metaclass is abc.ABCMeta.

一般用不着自己写新的ABCs


##### Subclassing an ABC

should implement all of the abstract methods

##### ABCs in the Standard Library
* Iterable, Container, Sized
* Collection
* Sequence, Mapping, Set
* MappingView
* Iterator
* Callable, Hashable


##### Defining and Using an ABC

1. To define an ABC, subclass `abc.ABC`.
2. An abstract method is marked with the
`@abc.abstractmethod` decorator, and often its body is empty except for a docstring. 
3. An ABC may include concrete methods.

##### ABC Syntax Details
`@abc.abstractmethod` should be the innermost decorator

##### Subclassing an ABC
`@abc.abstractmethod` must be overridden.

##### A Virtual Subclass of an ABC
`@AnABC.register` or `AnABC.register(cls)`

##### Usage of register in Practice


##### Structural Typing with ABCs
`__subclasshook__`
