#### The Command Pattern

> Commands are an object-oriented replacement for callbacks.

The question is: do we need an object-oriented replacement for callbacks? Sometimes yes, but not always.

```python

class MacroCommand: 
    """A command that executes a list of commands"""
    
    def __init__(self, commands): 
        self.commands = list(commands) 
    
    def __call__(self): 
        for command in self.commands: 
        command()
```

every Python callable implements a single-method interface, and that method is named `__call__`.
