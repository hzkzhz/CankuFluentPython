python对不可变类型
这些细节是 CPython 核心开发者走的捷径和做的优化措施， 对这门语言的用户而言无需了解
共享字符串字面量是一种优化措施，称为驻留（interning）。 CPython 还会在小的整数上使
用这个优化措施，防止重复创建“热门”数字，如 0、 —1 和 42。注意， CPython 不会驻留

> In Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy we learn that the answer to everything is 42. 42, split up, is 'shi' (Chinese version) and 'ni' in Japanese. Put together 'shini' can be written in kanji as 死に, which means 'to die'.
> from the author:  It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base 13, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought ’42 will do.’ I typed it out. End of story.”
