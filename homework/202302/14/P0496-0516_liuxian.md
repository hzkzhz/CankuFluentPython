#### Static Protocols

##### The Typed double Function
```python
from typing import TypeVar, Protocol
T = TypeVar('T')

class Repeatable(Protocol):
    def __mul__(self: T, repeat_count: int) -> T: ...

RT = TypeVar('RT', bound=Repeatable)

def double(x: RT) -> RT:
    return x * 2
```

##### Runtime Checkable Static Protocols
`@runtime_checkable`

##### Limitations of Runtime Protocol Checks

`isinstance/issubclass` checks only look at the presence or absence of methods, without checking their signatures, much less their type annotations.

##### Supporting a Static Protocol

##### Designing a Static Protocol

##### Best Practices for Protocol Design

##### Extending a Protocol
```python
@runtime_checkable 
class LoadableRandomPicker(other_prjotocol, Protocol):
    def xxx(self, *args) -> None: ...
```

##### The numbers ABCs and Numeric Protocols

* The numbers ABCs are fine for runtime type checking, but unsuitable for static typing. 
* The numeric static protocols SupportsComplex, SupportsFloat, etc. work well for static typing, but are unreliable for runtime type checking when complex numbers are involved.
