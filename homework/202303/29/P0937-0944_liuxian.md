### CHAPTER 24 Class Metaprogramming

For the sake of readability and maintainability, you should proba‐ bly avoid the techniques described in this chapter in application code.

#### Classes as Objects

`__class__, __name__,  __mro__, __bases__, __qualname__, __subclasses__`

None of the attributes mentioned in this section are listed by the `dir(…)` function.

#### type: The Built-In Class Factory
```python
MyClass = type('MyClass', 
                     (MySuperClass, MyMixin), 
                     {'x': 42, 'x2': lambda self: self.x * 2}, 
                 )
```

The `type` class is a metaclass: a class that builds classes.

#### A Class Factory Function
用代码创建类的例子，应该有更简洁的方案
